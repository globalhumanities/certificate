The ‘Western’ philosophical tradition notoriously derided and dismissed other currents of thought, while also at different points drawing on these for inspiration. The very discipline of ‘philosophy’ itself is not a cultural universal: ‘thought’ also resides in religious beliefs and practices, and in other ways of articulating ideas, such as symbolism, movement, and ritual. The certificate seeks to allow students to gain an understanding of histories of thought beyond those with which they may already be familiar, and to relativize the claims of dominant traditions, while gaining an appreciation of their complexity. This dimension of the curriculum incorporates courses that reflect specifically on what a ‘global’ framework for intellectual life might mean, examining histories and cultures of globalization, and modes of thought which try to take account of and become informed by a global perspective. Courses in this area also deal with contemporary global issues illuminated by a discipline of the humanities.</span></p></li></ul></td><td style="width: 33.3809%;"><ul><li class="align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This aspect of the curriculum addresses the works of art and culture that are objects of study in a number of disciplines of the humanities. How do works of the imagination show the trace of a global awareness or background? What distinctive traditions can we observe across the world in the creation of aesthetic effects and performances, in linguistic artefacts and narratives? How have these traditions interacted or borrowed from one another? What were and are the processes (economic, political and ideological) whereby imaginative capacities and creations become suppressed, censored, or erased? How do marginal voices and identities survive and reach an audience? The courses in this part of the certificate introduce the human record of art and culture from a wide variety of contexts and in cross-cultural exchange and conflict. They also address the history of institutions of culture and how these have responded to global histories and debates. Contemporary art production and the ways in which it is informed by a global space and global audiences (in its formats and materials) features as part of the certificate. Courses focus on imaginative creations themselves, on dynamics of circulation and destruction, and on the power of the imagination to conceive new worlds and possibilities.</span></li></ul></td><td style="width: 33.3809%;"><ul><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storytelling is one of the few incontrovertible human cultural universals. Whatever their actual beliefs and practices, all cultures engage in storytelling. Even the rudimentary markings that record the first known human languages, or the lists that form the first historical chronologies, can be said to shape a world. This is what a story does by articulating the coordinates of where it is situated in time and space, and by giving a meaning to that context. The stories that the earliest human cultures tell provide an identity. Early epic poems tell their listeners of heroic warrior ancestors. Stories can also challenge this identity, or record the fragmented, confusing experience of being human, as well as experiences of conflict and catastrophe. History writing in particular can subject heroic stories of cultural grandeur or other flattering myths to critical analysis and empirical testing. While history-writing too tells a story, and can be close to the literary in style, it seeks to reexamine received wisdom, study archival records, and shed light on neglected areas of knowledge. Courses in this area of the certificate explore stories and storytelling traditions from around the world, as well as competing and contradictory stories. They also focus on global and regional histories, and the theory and methodology of history-writing.</span></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div></article><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><button onclick="history.back()">&laquo; Back</button></div></div></main><footer id="copyright"><h6><span style="color: #ffffff;">Global Humanities</span><br><span style="color: #ffffff;">Webpages developers:</span><br><span style="color: #ffffff;">Diana Sarasti (d.sarasti@uniandes.edu.co) and Angélica Blanco (am.blanco@uniandes.edu.co)</span><br><span style="color: #ffffff;">Supervisor: Sergio Rodríguez (sl.rodriguez48@uniandes.edu.co)</span><br><span style="color: #ffffff;">Content creators/curators:Christopher Baker (baker_ch@auca.kg); Andrea Lozano Vásquez (a.lozano72@uniandes.edu.co)</span></h6><p> </p></footer></div><script src="https://globalhumanities.github.io/certificate/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://globalhumanities.github.io/certificate/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://globalhumanities.github.io/certificate/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://globalhumanities.github.io/certificate/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://globalhumanities.github.io/certificate/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://globalhumanities.github.io/certificate/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://globalhumanities.github.io/certificate/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
