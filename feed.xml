                <h4 class="align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Global Humanities Certificate invites students to step beyond borders—intellectual, cultural, and creative—to explore what it means to be human in a rapidly changing world. Through interdisciplinary study of literature, art, philosophy, and history, the program encourages critical thinking and creativity by engaging students with global perspectives in three main areas: how cultures shape ideas, how imagination and the arts connect people, and how stories and histories reveal and reshape our collective identities.</span></h4>
